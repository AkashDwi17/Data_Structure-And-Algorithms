🔥 MASTER INTERVIEW QUESTION – INHERITANCE (REAL-WORLD + TRAPS)
🧩 SCENARIO: NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

You are working on a large-scale notification system used by multiple applications.

There are different types of notifications:

Email Notification

SMS Notification

Push Notification

All notifications:

have a recipient

have a message

can be sent

can be logged

But:

Email needs subject

SMS has character limit

Push notification has device token

🎯 INTERVIEWER QUESTIONS (YOU MUST ANSWER ALL)
1️⃣ BASE DESIGN (INHERITANCE)

How will you design the base Notification class?

What should be common in parent?

What should be forced on child classes?

👉 Write class structure (Java / pseudo-code).

2️⃣ OVERRIDING vs HIDING (TRAP ⚠️)
class Notification {
    void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending notification");
    }

    static void log() {
        System.out.println("Logging notification");
    }
}

class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending email");
    }

    static void log() {
        System.out.println("Logging email");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Notification n = new EmailNotification();
        n.send();
        n.log();
    }
}


👉 What will be the output and WHY?
Explain like an interviewer expects (compile time vs runtime).

3️⃣ final KEYWORD (DESIGN THINKING)

Which method (if any) should be marked final?

Why would marking send() as final be a bad design here?

Where does final actually make sense?

4️⃣ LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (ADVANCED)

Interviewers love this 👇

Can EmailNotification be safely replaced by Notification everywhere?

Give one example where LSP can be broken in this system.

How would you fix it?

5️⃣ REAL EXPERIENCE QUESTION (3+ YEARS LEVEL)

“Inheritance is often misused.
When would you avoid inheritance here and use composition instead?”

Answer with:

one real scenario

one design reason

one performance/maintenance reason
